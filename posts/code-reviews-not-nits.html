        <h1>Code reviews not nits</h1>
        <p>
            Too often as a team grows you start to see the emergence of code-review nitpicks. <br>
            For example:<br>
            <em>"You should order your attributes in alphabetical order"</em><br>
            <em>"Your DOM needs to be aligned like so"</em>,<br>
            <em>"This variable name needs to be underscore and not camelCase"</em>,<br>
            <em>"Replace 0px with 0"</em><br>and so on and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            While these comments are coming from a good place, and heck your style-guide probably calls for it, the
            goal of <strong>consistency</strong> from code-review is at odds with manually commenting on these
            style-guide rules. Each team member will interpret the rules and their strictness differently, each rule
            enforcement adding more opportunity for <strong>variability </strong>on how and if a rule is enforced.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you are on the receiving end of these reviews one might think "<em>code-reviewer Sally really does a
                great job finding all of these style issues in my code! She really looks close at every line</em>", or
            "<em>Wow code-reviewer Tommy does a great job catching things that everyone else missed in code-review</em>".
            While Sally and Tommy are doing a great job catching this class of issue, they are simply pattern-matching,
            this pattern-matching review style leads to error blindness during code-review. Whether you think you do or
            not, we all have an internal counter that ticks up for every code comment we leave during code-review. When
            that number gets high enough we start moving faster, and missing things. Style nitpicks artificially leave
            us scanning instead of reviewing, missing real errors with a false sense of comment security.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might be thinking, oh wow this sounds like my team, or hmm I can see how this would become an issue on
            a team as it grows.. Or you might be thinking no-way would this ever happen to <strong>my team</strong>. I
            am sorry to say that it will happen, it will happen slowly, and before you know it you will see the rise of
            the nits, and the rise of frustration from variable code-reviews.
        </p>
        <p>
            We already use computers for pattern matching with code linting, why not extend it to style guide
            enforcement as well? Oh yeah and that frustration thing that people experience due to these nits? Turns out
            people have a pretty hard time thinking that a robot is singling them out during code review :D
        </p>
        <p>
            So this robot thing... Let me Introduce you to your future friend <del>nit </del>lint-bot [implementation
            left to the reader].
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
LINTS = [{
    fileRegex: ".*\.css",
    prohibitedRegex: /0px/,
    errorMessage: "replace 0px with 0 for css units"
}]
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Lint-bot for every code-review reads in all of the configured lints and then scans the appropriate files
            executing the prohibited regex and commenting where it finds patterns that match. While Lint-bot is not a
            catch-all for every case, in my experience it does catch and prevent 90~% of the human pattern matching
            comments, driving down pattern-matching and increasing code-review quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you take away anything from reading this I hope it is this: Next time someone leaves a code-review
            nitpick ask a simple question "What kind of automatic check would have caught this?". If there is no
            automatic way to catch the nitpick, it's probably unhelpful.
