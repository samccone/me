                    So far, working at a newspaper has shown me just how little I knew about how photos work in a paper.

Ohio University drives home assignments such as "picture story," "sports action" and "issue reporting," but does little to prepare photojournalists for those assignments for which one is expected to go into someone's home, talk to them about "insert issue here" and make an image of them that drives home that issue.

Here is a picture I took today on assignment. This is the grandmother and mother of a 4-year-old who was killed by a driver while crossing the street.
