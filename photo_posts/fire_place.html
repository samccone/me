                    <blockquote><span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: small;">The  hill stood cold as the wind blew past the tops of the matted grass,  having been pushed down from the bodies of deer resting for the night.  The sky’s grey, muting the greens and drawing the hues of blue out  from hiding. The sun has long been set away for the season, occasionally  peaking to see what is new, but mostly gone. Remnants of its glow still  cast soft shadows around the edges of edges. </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: small;">The  growth has stopped, time only passing from the white sliver rotating  around the lower arch of the sky set back in black. I am laying face  up, back damp from the moisture sucked into the cotton; mind awash,  figureless, like the shapes in the sky.</span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: small;">The  trees are breathing, the moss clinging on, surveying the land, fixating  — uptaking — silent. In the distance, the lights blink red — red  — red — white. The light is tapered at the edges by the fog that  rises from the hills into the chilled air, the last heat of the season  escaping the branches of the pines. </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: small;">Stripes  run through the woods, the metallic towers looming with their lines  running into the valleys off into the invisible distance. They hum from  their invisible provider. Silent are the woods; all is gone. Not making  a noise. </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: small;">The  evidence of a colorful past sits as it did when it fell on the forest  floor. My falling feet cast a crunch deep into the labyrinth of scattered  oaks and maple, marring the eternal silence, only for it once to occur  again. The mud from the riverbed still clinging to my feet as I walk  deeper.</span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: small;">The  lights trickle onto the ground through the web of black branches entangling  one another in a slow death grip. Ivy vines climb those looming structures  in search of that valuable resource that so scarcely makes it to the  ground. </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: small;">The  hills peak and sink — predictably — like ripples in a pond. Frozen.  Boulders cover the bases where the two peaks push against one another.  Forever. Water emerges at the bottom, pushed up through the ground,  pooling and spreading across, enabling an array of slippery greens to  amass on the ground. Tracks frozen in the surrounding muck, evidence  of life invisible in the unpalatable space. </span></blockquote>
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">-from those woods</span></span>
