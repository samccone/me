                    <h1>Singing Painter</h1>
                    <i class="date">6/22/2009</i></br>
                    I spent some time with a gentleman who paints houses for a living and recently started singing gospel music to his son for therapy.

His son was born with spina bifida and had meningitis as a baby, which left him mentally handicap.

Going into this assignment, I knew I did not want to only show some person with a handicap; rather, I wanted to focus on the relationship that exists between father and son.
