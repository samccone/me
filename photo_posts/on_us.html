                    Stories are something that everyone can relate with, the threads that pull them together are woven throughout all of our life's.

The demise of distributed stories is the breaking of those threads that tie us all together.

Without those, there is little to hold back further separation of people and their experiences with all.

What is a mind--

a life--

with nothing more than our singular experiences, never shared but held for one self.

To share with others is to learn about others,
by learning about others we are connected through an intangible manifestation of a relationship that is shared usually knowingly.

That relationship give us our humanity---

That relationship makes us who we are and who we all are.
