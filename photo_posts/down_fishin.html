                    Recently, I have had an image in my head of a photograph by <a href="http://www.jimkorpi.com/" target="_blank">Jim Korpi</a> showing two boys with their fishing poles standing on train tracks in Vermont.

Every time I drive around looking for features, that image is all that is in my head.

I have also been inspired by the work of <a href="http://www.reduxpictures.com/portfolios/frazier/">Danny Wilcox Frazier</a> and his project <a href="http://mediastorm.org/0025.htm" target="_blank">Driftess</a>.

Enough rambling. I was lucky enough to stumble across some boys carrying fishing poles, so I decided to tag along.
